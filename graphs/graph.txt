**Graphs** 

A very common way of representing networks with entities and relationships between them. 

**What does a graph consist of**

- set of Vertices and Edges G=(V,E)
- Edge is a pair of vertices E=(V1,V2) where the vertcies are distinct 
- two vertices being *Adjacent* means they are connected by a single edge 
- the *degree* is the number of neighbours of that vertex 
- a path of length K from vertex u to ws is a sequence of edges where u is the origin and v is the destination. In a path, all the vertices must be distinct 
length of the path = number of edges used in the sequence 
- max number of edges = n(n-1)/2 

NOTE: connected means there is a path to get from vertex A to B. but adjacent means there is an edge between them. Two vertices can be connected but not adjacent


Edge restrictions: 

we cannot have a vertex with an edge to itself and all edges are symmetric
