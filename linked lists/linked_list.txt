We know lists are ARRAY based implementation of List abstract data types. Inserting and deleting items in a python list can require shifting many elements in computer memory. Inserting and deleting at the front of a Python list can take 0(n) time where n is the length of the list.
Lists store elements in contigeous block of memory, so items need to be shifted around when inserting or deleting. Linked lists have references to the next object. 


_Node represents a single element of the list. Each node has next and item. The last node points to none.
