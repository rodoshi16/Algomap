***Tree***
- root 
- subtree

For regular trees, there can be multiple subtrees of a single node

***Binary tree***
- root
- left
- right 

Binary trees MUST have at most 2 children per node. This is the only rule, 
no other rules about any values. 

***Binary search tree***
- root 
- left 
- right 

AND left < right

***Complete binary tree***
- other than the last level, all nodes must have 2 children
- the nodes on the last level should fill out left to right
- NO rules about left < right

***Full binary tree***
- all nodes on all levels must have exactly 2 children 


HEAPS are based on a complete binary tree


***Max heap***
- complete binary tree 
- parent is always greater than the 2 children 

***Min heap***
- complete binary tree
- parent is always less than the 2 children
