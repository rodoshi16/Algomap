Arrays can be Static or Dynamic.

Static arrays -> An array for which the size or length is determined when the array is created/allocated. We start
at 0 and the last position is n-1. In a static array, you can still

- index an element
- add/remove

However, the size is determined based on the numbers provided during initialization which is fixed once defined. The memory is
allocated on the stack.

Dynamic arrays -> Array size is not fixed, memory allocation occurs during runtime. The location is in heap memory space.
Heap is a tree based structure which is used to implement a priority queue.
